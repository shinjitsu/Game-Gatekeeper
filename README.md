# Game-Gatekeeper
## Motivation:
My children are homeschooled and during the Covid lockdowns I was often away at work 
while the children worked on their schooling while only one parent was there to supervise several
students/children. This led to some of the children to sneak playing games while they should be 
working. This is my "build a better mousetrap" approach to helping them stay on track.

## Linux
all of my machines run linux so my first pass approach only runs on linux.

## Current state
this is currently an early approach that lives on the client only. Eventually I'd like to have this query a server 
so that when the work is done, a parent could remotely enable some or all of the games again
